\usage{
qgis_plugins(which = "all", query = FALSE, quiet = TRUE, ...)

qgis_disable_plugins(names = NULL, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{which}{String defining which plugins to select, based on their
status in QGIS (enabled or disabled).
Must be one of: \code{"all"}, \code{"enabled"}, \code{"disabled"}.}

\item{query}{Use \code{TRUE} to refresh the cached value.}

\item{quiet}{Use \code{FALSE} to display more information about the command, possibly
useful for debugging.}

\item{...}{Only used by other functions calling this function.}

\item{names}{Optional character vector of plugin names.}
}
\value{

}
\description{
\code{qgis_plugins()} lists the available plugins that implement Processing
providers.
\code{qgis_enable_plugins()} enables plugins while \code{qgis_disable_plugins()}
does the reverse.
}
\details{
The cache is immediately updated upon enabling or disabling plugins from R.

If you installed, removed, enabled or disabled plugins in the QGIS GUI, then
run \code{qgis_configure()} to make those changes available in R.

If \code{names} is not provided to \code{qgis_enable_plugins()}, it is assumed that all
\emph{disabled} plugins are to be enabled.
If \code{names} is not provided to \code{qgis_disable_plugins()}, it is assumed that all
\emph{enabled} plugins are to be disabled.
Note that the 'processing' plugin is ignored, because it is always available
to 'qgis_process' (not QGIS though).
}
\note{
Only plugins that implement Processing providers are supported.
Installing or removing plugins is not supported.

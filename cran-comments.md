## This version includes a change at CRANâ€™s request

This version includes a fix to solve the ERRORs in the CRAN check results page at <https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_qgisprocess.html> (as consulted 6 Feb 2024). A unit test for 'terra' compatibility failed. It was the unit test itself that needed updating in order to comply with current 'terra' behaviour.

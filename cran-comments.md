## DESCRIPTION file: no references to package methods exist

In order to ease the reviewing process, we like to anticipate a possible note.

Apart from the package documentation and website, no separate references exist
that document the package methods.
However in the Description field of DESCRIPTION, a reference has been added to 
the online documentation of 'QGIS' processing algorithms, since these are key in 
using the package.

* This is a new release.

* Package suggested but not available for checking: 'spDataLarge'

  The 'spDataLarge' package is available from the
  https://geocompr.r-universe.dev repository, which is included in the
  Additional_repositories field of DESCRIPTION. The package is used in a
  vignette.

## DESCRIPTION file: no references to package methods exist

In order to ease the reviewing process, we like to anticipate a possible note.

Apart from the package documentation and website, no separate references exist
that document the package methods.
However in the Description field of DESCRIPTION, a reference has been added to 
the online documentation of 'QGIS' processing algorithms, since these are key in 
using the package.

# qgisprocess (development version)

# qgisprocess 0.1.0

- Initial CRAN submission.
- While the package incubated as a development version for a few years, quite a few namespace changes have been made more recently (#153).
Old function names still work but these are deprecated.
They will be dropped at a later stage.
